    "## k-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into k groups\n",
    "3. For each unique group:\n",
    "- Take the group as a hold out or test data set\n",
    "- Take the remaining groups as a training data set\n",
    "- Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n",
    "- Retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n",
    "4. Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, each observation in the data sample is assigned to an individual group and stays in that group for the duration of the procedure. This means that each sample is given the opportunity to be used in the hold out set 1 time and used to train the model k-1 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method is fit on the remaining k âˆ’ 1 folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important that any preparation of the data prior to fitting the model occur on the CV-assigned training dataset within the loop rather than on the broader data set. This also applies to any tuning of hyperparameters. A failure to perform these operations within the loop may result in data leakage and an optimistic estimate of the model skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of a k-fold cross-validation run are often summarized with the mean of the model skill scores. It is also good practice to include a measure of the variance of the skill scores, such as the standard deviation or standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of k is usually 5 or 10, but there is no formal rule. As k gets larger, the difference in size between the training set and the resampling subsets gets smaller. As this difference decreases, the bias of the technique becomes smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "A value of k=10 is very common in the field of applied machine learning, and is recommend if you are struggling to choose a value for your dataset."
